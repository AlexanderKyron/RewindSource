# RewindSource
The source code for my 7 Day Game Jam project, R3WiND. Supports Unreal 4.25 currently. I'll be updating it to 4.26 over the coming days. Doesn't include content (for now) as it contains nonfree assets, so it's only the source folder.

Code is rather unclean as it was made in 7 days for a game jam, and most of the code was written over the first 2-3, but I figured I'd post it up here to get something I've done open source. I'll be cleaning up this code as I go
